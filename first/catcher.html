        <h3>
            1. This book is an amazing piece of work and should be praised by all students who read it.
             No matter how many poor reviews you may see from discouraged readers, DON'T listen to them!
             Most remarks saying this book is "terrible" or "boring" are simply ignorant children who
            don't understand the importance of the words they're reading.
            This book is not only a great introduction into free thinking for children but also a
            great reminder to adults that child is the father of man. For no matter how old someone
            may grow to be, they can still find a shred of themselves in the main character Holden.
            It's a truly great book that somehow manages to find a connection with nearly everyone
            who reads it.

            2. I would definitely say that this book seems to target an older audience, 
            probably no one younger than high school age. As a teenager, I relate to the main character,
             Holden, in many ways; we appear to have similar views on our classmates and such.
              However, I felt like there was no real plot to the book, and at times that kind of annoyed me,
               like I was always waiting for something to happen but it never did. The ending was my favorite
               art, and I think I would have liked it a lot less if it hadn't ended the way it did. 
               Overall, I think it was very intelligently written. I would recommend it primarily to those
             who enjoy books that are more freely written and don't have to tie back to a specific plot.
        </h3>

        <h3>
            3.This book has no plot, and there is too much cursing within every other word and it takes 
            all the focus of the plot. Do not recommend. I have to read this next year and I'm doing 
            summer reading to pre-read books. Why do they still have this in sophomore curriculum?
