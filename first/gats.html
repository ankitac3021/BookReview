        <h3>
            1. This book is a work of literal perfection. 
            By not enjoying this book, you are failing to appreciate the entire life story of a
             deeply troubled individual. Fitzgerald's work in "The Great Gatsby" is not only beautiful 
             but amazingly prevalent. His commentary on the American dream and the poison of wealth
              are truly mind blowing. Fitzgerald is one of the greats for a reason and that reason IS, 
              "The Great Gatsby" 
        </h3>

            2. One of my favorite classic books. 
            Its such a detailed book about the 1920's time period and 
            its really eye-catching. There's a bunch of romance and tragedy 
            throughout the book, which can provide a lot of suspense for the audience</h3>

            <h3>
                   3. I love this book. Epic story, epic character, absolutely epic soundtrack,
                     absolutely epic tie in with Final Fantasy 8 and Persona 5. Overall? I rate it 4/10!
            </h3>
