            1. Okay. I love books about magic and a fantasy world.  But I'm not this kinda of fantasy. 
            I like fairy tale magic. Like my favorite TV show once upon a time. Or my favorite books land
             of stories or sisters Grimm can't choose really. I read the first one and I didn't really 
              it it was okay I guess. But I didn't really give me that magic feeling that people say they do. 
              Its a little overrated in my opinio. Oh the universal harry potter rides are so good. .
               the movies are good. I only read this book because I didn't want to read the others they were
                too long for something you don't even really like .

            2. i really love this book, Percy Jackson! Its so good rick rordan did a great job on writing
             the story i mean i felt so educated on greek mythology it was amazing! i hope more percy
              jackson books come and NO MORE HARRY POTTER the plot is sosososo easy to guess i mean this 
              story sends clues and nobody notices them on how the story will end!! I guess yall are 
              pretty dumb readers. :\
